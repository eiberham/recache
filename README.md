# recache
Restart arc cache

Alright this is a tiny tool i built out of necessity in order to help me speed things up in my job, what it does 
comes down to let me start or stop a docker container in case it's running or stopped with just a couple clicks. 
As i work with a framework built on top of react and it kind of has a docker container inside which among other 
things cache its api content i need a way to somewhat shut down this functionality during development so  as i'm 
a golang beginner i thought it would be a good challenge to see if i could do it.
